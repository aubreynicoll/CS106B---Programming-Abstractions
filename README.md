# Stanford CS106B - Programming Abstractions in C++

Welcome. This repo contains my work for Stanford Engineering's CS106B course, offered for free as part of [Stanford Engineering Everywhere](https://see.stanford.edu/).

### Resources

* Text: *Programming Abstractions in C++*; Eric S. Roberts, 2014
* Video: [Julie Zelensky's Lectures](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106B)
* Assignments: Exercises from the book, and those from the 2008 course

### Assignments

The exercises taken from the book are arranged by chapter. The assignments taken from the course are arranged by Section and Assignment. In the course, the Section work is considered to be optional, where Assignment work is required; however, please read the disclaimer below.

### Disclaimer
I began this course by focusing heavily on the video lectures; however, the very old Stanford library from 2008 was not working on my Mac in 2021, and they didn't provide the actual source code, so I haven't done every single assignment that came with the course on SEE. Those that required the use of graphics were particularly out of the question.

Given that, I decided to pick up the book after about two weeks. The 2014 book does provide source code that works, and since then I have considered the lectures (and its assignments) to be secondary to the book and its exercises.

I will update this document again when I finish the course.
